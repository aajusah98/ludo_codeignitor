            <li>Every game will have some elements of chance but in the form of challenges/obstacles that a User would overcome using his/her skills and knowledge of the game. Elements of luck are present in every game to add thrill and excitement, but no two attempts at a game are identical, so Users must use their skills to succeed.</li>
            <li>Since the games available on our platform can be won through Users’ skills and such skills may be enhanced with practice and experience, a User's performance may improve with time and practice.</li>
